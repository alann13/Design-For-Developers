This repo hosts code/notes taken from the course https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/

## Introduction

- Myth right vs left brain : https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222
- Right brain left brain article: https://www.britannica.com/story/are-there-really-right-brained-and-left-brained-people
- The more you use your brain in different types of ways. The stronger it becomes. Learning other uncomfortable things can make you a better developer.
- This course is not a replacement for design school. There will be lots of ressources to work from.
- This course is a place to understand some basic concepts. Tips on communicating with designers.
- We improve through repetition and reiteration along the way. Not theorizing about perfection.
- In the stage of learning and understanding : Quantity > Quality.
- A good way to have people interested in your code is through good design.

  <summary>Layout</summary>

- Grid systems are an old concept. They bring order to chaos and help to focus on navigating its space.
- We as humans thought of organizing things in systems of grids so we can find them easier.
- We can play with the base concept of the entire layout with just a few blocks rather than figuring out everything at once.

- Balance and symmetry: if you want to convey attention to a certain area, you can somehow break the rythme and keep the eye moving around.
- People do tend to gravitate more towards an assymetrical canvas.
- Example of assymetrical work : https://dribbble.com/Orizon
- Rule of thirds: Break your piece into thirds and add your key element into one of the third. : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds
- Swiss deisgn is using and making and breaking grids.
- Saccade: a rapid movement of the eye between fixation points. Even if you are staring at an image, your eye is still scanning around for moving parts.
- Circles draw your eye more than other shapes.
- Scaling and cropping techniques can make your piece dynamic or a part of your layout.
- Book on grid and composition: https://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Second-Updated-Expanded/dp/163159284X
- Anchoring things to one another to make things cohesive.
- If you are looking to move some elements of a design to another area, designers might ask questions to preserve anchoring or find another solutions with other anchoring techniques. They still need to follow some design rules while solving problems.
